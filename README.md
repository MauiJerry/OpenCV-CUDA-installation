# OpenCV-CUDA-installation
A save of the process needed to build manually OpenCV for Python 3 with CUDA bindings on Windows 10. Tested on a Windows 10 20H2 machine with i7-10700 CPU @ 2.90GHz and GeForce RTX 2080 Ti.

## Sources and troubleshooting references

The process is based on [this tutorial by Anindya](https://thinkinfi.com/install-opencv-gpu-with-cuda-for-windows-10/) for the step-by-step process with CMake GUI and [this tutorial by James Bowley](https://thinkinfi.com/install-opencv-gpu-with-cuda-for-windows-10/) for the process with command line CMake and some troubleshooting.

### ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cv2: The specified module could not be found.

Both of these tutorials should be enough for most people. **But** in some cases, even if the module was successfully installed in your Python installation, you may end up with this `ImportError: DLL load failed while importing cv2: The specified module could not be found.` message when importing OpenCV with `import cv2`.

This case is detailed at the end and is almost entirely based on [this quite extensive github issue](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/issues/19972). Basically your whole installation may be completely successful, it may just be Python failing to read your environment variables.

## Step-by-step installation process

### Prerequisites

- Visual Studio with C++ build tools
- [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) according to your GPU
- [cuDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive) corresponding to CUDA (free account creation needed to download)
- Python 3 install
- NumPy
- OpenCV [from source](https://github.com/opencv/opencv/releases) and OpenCV [contrib modules from source](https://github.com/opencv/opencv_contrib/tags)
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/)

Check that your GPU is compatible with CUDA: [wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported).

### Python, NumPy and pip

#### Python install

Install a recent Python 3.x (3.8.10 here) however you prefer (Python website, Anaconda, Windows store, create a virtual env...), but if you are here that's probably already done.

Make sure you have NumPy installed or install it with `pip install numpy`. Uninstall any OpenCV python module `pip uninstall opencv-python` or `pip uninstall opencv-contrib-python`. Delete the `YOUR_PYTHON_PATH/Lib/site-packages/cv2` folder for cleaning purposes.

### Visual Studio

Download Visual Studio ([2019 version here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/fr/vs/older-downloads/#visual-studio-2019-and-other-products)) and install the build tools for C++ from the Visual Studio Installer.

### CUDA and cuDNN

Download and install the latest [CUDA toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-downloads) compatible with your GPU ([see here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported) for compatibility as well) or check you already have it installed in `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA GPU Computing Toolkit`.

Idem for cuDNN with an intermediary step to create a NVIDIA developer account, fill up their survey etc.

Check in your environment variables that `CUDA_PATH` and `CUDA_PATH_Vxx_x` are here and pointing to your install path.

Copy the files in the cuDNN folders (under `C:\Program Files\NVIDIA\CUDNN\vX.X`) **bin**, **include** and **lib/x64** to the corresponding folders in your CUDA folder.

### OpenCV

Download and extract matching versions of OpenCV and OpenCV-contrib from the [links above](README.md#prerequisites).

### CMake configuration

#### Preparation

Prepare a **"build"** folder with your OpenCV extracted folders.

![explorer_bSMon2LQY0](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28230243/166434918-458aa3ae-8696-4cee-bb8e-5d9713401147.png)

Edit the end of the _OpenCVDetectPython.cmake_ file in _opencv-x.x.x/cmake_. Move the second _elseif_ above the first to get this:

![notepad++_Zwz4Lsl2kZ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28230243/166435763-da8d2429-ba15-45ab-aede-ec61a6715cbc.png)

This will prioritize the use of your Python 3 installation for the build.

#### CMake GUI build configuration

Provide the paths to the OpenCV and target build folders:

![cmake-gui_IBQybmF6kh](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28230243/166436165-126efd0b-43e5-4d1a-9e8a-1d46dbec7f35.png)

Hit _Configure_ and select _x64_ as the _Optional platform for generator_, then hit finish to start the first round of configuration.

Once this is done edit the following parameters:
| Name | Value |
|---|:---:|
| ENABLE_FAST_MATH | âœ… |
| OPENCV_DNN_CUDA | âœ… |
| OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH | path of **modules** directory in extracted opencv_contrib-x.x.x |
| OPENCV_PYTHON3_VERSION | âœ… |
| WITH_CUDA | âœ… |
<!--| BUILD_SHARED_LIBS | ðŸ”³ |-->

Check the PYTHON3_... parameters so that the paths correspond to what you expect.
Note that the path separator in OPENCV_EXTRA_MODULES_PATH (or any other parameter value) has to be "/" and _not "\\"_.

Hit _Configure_ again.

Edit two more parameters:
| Name | Value |
|---|:---:|
| CUDA_FAST_MATH | âœ… |
| CUDA_ARCH_BIN | x.x |

The CUDA_ARCH_BIN corresponding to your GPU is the value found in the left column of the [GPU support table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CUDA#GPUs_supported). For instance "7.5" for the RTX 2080 Ti.

Hit _Configure_ for the final configuration round.
Once the configuration is done you should not have any parameter left in red.
Now hit _Generate_. When generation is finished we are done with CMake.

### Build the project with Visual Studio

Open the `OpenCV.sln` just created in the build folder.

Go in Tools>Options... in "Projects and Solutions > Web Projects" uncheck the last parameter. Continue if it was already unchecked, otherwise close Visual Studio and reopen `OpenCV.sln`.

Change the "Debug" mode to "Release".

![debug2release](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/28230243/166443402-9e1cdd4b-245e-4d0e-a202-6e1b3b9edac1.png)

In the solution explorer expand **CMakeTargets**, right-click **ALL_BUILD** and select **Build**. This will take about half an hour.

Then repeat the step for **INSTALL** (right below **ALL_BUILD**).
Check for errors in the two building steps, if everything is fine you are done.
